# Enhancing a Quiz App 
iOS Techdegree Project 2

** As a developer, one of things you need to get comfortable with is working with code that other people have written. In this project, improve an existing iOS quiz app to allow for more questions, improve the user interface, and customize the content to match your own interests. **

# Required Tasks
- Convert the Storyboard back to a universal scene and add constraints to maintain the layout such all UI elements are sized and spaced appropriately for all iPhones of screen sizes 4.7 and 5.5. inches.
- Refactor the existing code such that individual questions are modeled using a class or struct.
- Ensure that code adheres to the MVC pattern.
- Enhance the quiz so it can accommodate four answer choices for each question, as shown in the mockups and sample question set.
- Add functionality such that during each game, questions are chosen at random, though no question will be repeated within a single game.
